## Feature Selection in Machine Learning

Feature selection plays a critical role in machine learning by improving model performance through the elimination of irrelevant or redundant features. This process not only reduces computational complexity but also mitigates overfitting, thereby enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to generalize to new data. By prioritizing the most informative features, we can build more efficient and interpretable models.

To demonstrate Special feature selection techniques, I have created a notebook that covers the following methods:

- Information Gain  
- Chi-Square Test  
- Fisher Score  
- Variance Threshold  
- Mean Absolute Difference (MAD)  
- Correlation Analysis
